## Overview

**Code Job Finder** is a dynamic tool designed for analyzing programming job vacancies from major Russian job platforms, HeadHunter and SuperJob. Enhanced with features to control the parsing depth and request frequency, it provides a more efficient and reliable data collection process. This tool is specifically tailored for job market research in Moscow, delivering insights into various programming languages' demand, vacancies availability, and salary trends. It's an invaluable resource for both job seekers and market analysts looking to understand the programming job landscape.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Vacancy Data Retrieval:** gathers detailed information about programming job vacancies from HeadHunter and SuperJob.
- **Support for Popular Programming Languages:** includes data for languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, and others.
- **Page Control for API Requests:** users can set the maximum number of pages to parse from HeadHunter via an environment variable, optimizing performance and avoiding potential rate limits.
- **Request Throttling to Prevent Captcha:** implements a timeout feature to manage the frequency of API requests, ensuring the script does not trigger anti-bot mechanisms like captchas.
- **Analytical Insights:** provides statistics such as the number of vacancies, processed entries, and average salary calculations.
- **Flexible Configuration:** utilizes environment variables for settings like API keys and parsing parameters, facilitating easy customization.
- **AsciiTable for Readable Output:** displays data in a user-friendly table format using the AsciiTable library.
- **Salary Estimation Logic:** employs clear and adjustable salary calculation methods, avoiding 'magic numbers' and enhancing code readability.

## Installation

To install Code Job Finder, follow these steps:

### 1. üêç Environment setup

First of all, make sure you have Python 3 installed, version `3.8.0` or higher. If not, visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version.

The command to check your Python version should show a version no lower than `3.5.0`. You might need to use aliases such as `python`, `py`, `python3.8`, or onwards up to `python3.12` instead of `python3`.

```
$ python --version
Python 3.8.10
```

### 2. üì• Repository cloning

Clone the repository using the command below:

```
git clone https://github.com/WarLikeLaux/code-job-finder
```

Then, navigate to the project folder:

```
cd code-job-finder
```

### 3. üß© Dependencies installation

Use pip (or pip3, if there's a conflict with Python2) to install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. üóùÔ∏è Environment variables setup

To set up your environment variables, you'll need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. If you already have a `.env.example` file, you can simply copy with rename it to `.env` using the command `cp .env.example .env`. Once you've done this, add or/and fill the following lines by values in your `.env` file:

- `HH_MAX_PAGES`: the maximum number of pages to parse from HeadHunter. Default is `1`, which limits to one page. Set to `0` for unlimited pages or a specific number to limit the pages accordingly. This parameter is used to prevent heavy load on the script during data retrieval.
- `HH_TIMEOUT`: the time in seconds to wait between each request to the HeadHunter API to avoid triggering the captcha. The default value is `1`.
- `SJ_SECRET_KEY`: this key serves as your unique identifier for accessing the SuperJob API. It enables the retrieval of job vacancy data from the SuperJob platform. To obtain your personal API key, register at the [official SuperJob website](https://api.superjob.ru/register). This key is essential for authenticating your requests to the SuperJob API and accessing detailed vacancy information.

Please ensure that each environment variable is assigned the correct value.
